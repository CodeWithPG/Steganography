What is Steganography :

Steganography is not actually a method of encrypting messages, but hiding them within something else to enable them to pass undetected. Traditionally this was achieved with invisible ink, microfilm or taking the first letter from each word of a message. This is now achieved by hiding the message within a graphics. Form instance in a 256-greyscope image, if the least significant bit of each byte is replaced with a bit from the message then the result will be indistinguishable to the human eye. An eavesdropper will not even realize a message is being send. This is not Cryptography however, and although it would fool a human, a computer would be able to detect this very quickly and reproduce the original message.

In the case of using this technique of hiding the data with an image file, the visibility of the image, resolution or clarity is not being affected. The hidden data can be length in size. To the Hacker, only the image is make going to be visible when previewed and not a trace of the hidden data.

If the image file is opened across a text editor, then also the data is not going to be visible as the information is stored in an Encryption form, which is also binary. Hence making it difficult for the enclosure to differentiate the data to the image file.
